## Objective

Up to 90% of major lower extremity amputations (LEAMP) are being performed under general anesthesia, despite regional anesthesia being an acceptable option in most cases. Obtaining a better understanding of who would benefit from regional versus general anesthesia could reduce complications and contribute valuable information toward the establishment of best evidence-based practice. We hypothesized that patients undergoing  LEAMP with regional anesthesia would have better post-operative outcomes than patients receiving LEAMP with general anesthesia.

## Methods
The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) lower extremity amputation module was used to identify patients (â‰¥18 years) who underwent LEAMP between 2013 and 2018. Outcomes included 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Time to death was analyzed using standard survival analysis.

## Results
The final sample included 5,567 patients (median age: 65 years, 67% white, 65% male). Only 719 (13%) of patients received RA and 4,848 (87%) underwent GA. Compared to patients undergoing general anesthesia, patients in the regional group were older (67 vs 65 years, p<.001) and more likely to have diabetes (78% vs 69%; p < 0.001), end stage renal disease (26% vs 18%; p < 0.001), congestive heart failure (33% vs 27%; p < 0.01) and coronary artery disease (35% vs 30%; p < 0.01). The overall incidence of MACE, death, and MACE or death was 5%, 6%, 9%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference by anesthesia groups for MACE (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.69-1.39) or mortality (HR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.90-1.17).

## Conclusion 
There was no difference in outcomes in patients undergoing LEAMP between regional or general anesthesia techniques, despite the regional group having more comorbidities. Regional anesthesia remains under-utilized for patients undergoing LEAMP. Further studies are needed to establish best practices in LEAMP procedures.
